The book introduces Dafny programming language. Dafny is a hybrid language having functional and object oriented features. It shows us how to verify our programs by writing pre and post conditions, loop invariants, assertions and other constructs. Any program which actually gets accepted by the Dafny verifier is guaranteed to be totally correct. Using a binary search tree example they have shown how to run dafny verified programs. Functional programming can also be done in dafny. Preconditions and total functions are also explained in the chapter. List destructors are also defined in the chapter which plays an important role in writing dafny verified programs. It is possible to prove function properties in dafny and using example of natural numbers, even and odd numbers it is shown clearly. Some verifications which require auxiliary lemmas are also shown. There is a complete chapter that is dedicated to extending the development of proofs. Dafny also supports imperative programming which is like a subset to Java. Using bubble sort, incremental development of imperative programs is done. Pre-conditions and Post-conditions are used to specify our code, assume statements are used to allow users to skip some details which can added later and assert statements are there which indeed check if properties hold or not.
